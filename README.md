# OMDb API Application

This is a SwiftUI-based application that fetches and displays movie information using the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com). The project is structured with the MVVM architecture and uses native networking with `URLSession`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [OMDb API Key]([https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx]): Sign up and generate an API key.
- A Mac with Xcode installed to run and test the application.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/omdb-api-app.git
   cd omdb-api-app

   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode.

3. Create a `DownloaderClient.swift` file in the project and add your TMDb API key:

   ```swift
   let apiKey = "your_api_key_here"
   ```

4. Build and run the application:

   - Select your simulator or connected device in Xcode.
   - Press `Cmd + R` to build and run the app.

## Architecture

This project follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
- **View**: SwiftUI views that display the data.
- **ViewModel**: Handles the business logic and provides data to the views.

### Dependency Injection

- The services and view models are distributed using a **Factory** pattern, ensuring a single responsibility and reusability across the app.

## Caching

The app includes a lightweight caching mechanism to store and retrieve frequently used data, improving performance and reducing network calls.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Dart
- **UI Framework**: Flutter
- **Architecture**: MVVM
- **Network**: URLSession
- **Caching**: Custom in-memory caching solution (no third-party libraries used).
